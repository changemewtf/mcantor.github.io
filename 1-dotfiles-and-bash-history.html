                    <p>Using <code>Ctrl + P</code> or the up arrow is a handy way to recall recent commands in bash.</p>
<p>Like many command line features, bash's history tracking can be configured in its main dotfile, <code>.bashrc</code>.</p>

<h2>Dotfiles</h2>
<p>Dotfiles are just plain text files that applications read for configuration whenever they are run.</p>
<p>Windows uses a "Registry" instead, which is much more structured but way more of a hassle to modify.</p>
<p>By default, dotfiles are hidden from directory listing commands such as <code>ls</code>.
You can run <code>ls -a</code> to have it display <strong>all</strong> files, even "hidden" ones
like dotfiles.</p>
<p>Dotfiles that affect general program configuration (as opposed to folder-specific configuration) are
conventionally placed in your home directory, which is <code>/Users/username</code> on OS X and
<code>/home/username</code> on Linux.</p>

<h2>HISTIGNORE and HISTCONTROL</h2>
<p><code>HISTIGNORE</code> and <code>HISTCONTROL</code> are two environment variable which bash uses
to change the behavior of its history tracking.</p>
<p><code>HISTIGNORE</code> is a <code>:</code>-separated list of command patterns that bash should avoid saving
in its history file. For example:</p>
<p class="code">export HISTIGNORE="ls:man"</p>
<p>would ignore all <code>ls</code> and <code>man</code> commands.</p>
<p>To disable <code>HISTIGNORE</code>, you can simply delete the entire <code>export HISTIGNORE=...</code> line
from your <code>.bashrc</code>.</p>
<p><code>HISTCONTROL</code> is mostly used for ignoring duplicate entries and ignoring commands that start with
a space. You can have it ignore both by putting...</p>
<p class="code">export HISTCONTROL="ignoreboth"</p>
<p>in your <code>.bashrc</code>. You can add these lines anywhere in the file.</p>

<h2>Reloading bash configuration without restarting your shell</h2>
<p>If you're playing around with your configuration, it can get really annoying to keep restarting your shell.</p>
<p>Instead of quitting and re-opening it every time you modify your dotfiles, you can tell bash to read them again:</p>
<p class="code">source ~/.bashrc</p>
<p>This will trigger bash to read your <code>.bashrc</code> again and run your changes without having to quit and reload!</p>
